History
The anthem was adopted in 1978 and replaced the previous national anthem, "Nigeria, We Hail Thee".[1]

The lyrics are a combination of words and phrases taken from five of the best entries in a national contest. The words were put to music by the Nigerian Police Band under the directorship of Benedict P. Odiase (1934â€“2013). The Nigerian national anthem lyrics were created by five people: P. O. Aderibigbe, John A. Ilechukwu, Dr. Sota Omoigui, Eme tim Akpan and B.A. Ogunnaike.

Lyrics
Although the anthem has two verses, usually only the first is sung. On some occasions, the second verse is recited as "The National Prayer".
